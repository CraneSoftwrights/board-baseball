# Design resources directory

Here are the SVG design files. Layers of SVG from these files are copied into the collage files in the [`../build`](../build#readme) directory as objects to be manipulated there for burning. The design files always retain their contents as objects.

## Fonts

These design files use the "Noto Serif" and "Noto Sans" available for free from the [`https://fonts.google.com/noto`](https://fonts.google.com/noto) site. The compressed and extra-compressed font variants are used predominantly.
