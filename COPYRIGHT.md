Copyright is claimed on the board layout and the extended play rules only, but not on the basic play rules dice combinations.

The basic play rules dice combinations honour those used in many baseball dice games, four of which are found readily on Amazon:

The extended play dice combinations replace those combinations in basic play that specify pitching-based play results.
