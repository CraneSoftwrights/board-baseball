These are the outputs generated for Crane's Board Baseball game, maintained 
publicly in https://github.com/CraneSoftwrights/board-baseball

The PDF files are suitable for a laser cutter where cut directives are
lines with the width .001in. For distinction, these lines are magenta
coloured. All other lines are simply burned on the wood surface.

Directories in this ZIP:

 burn/ - a set of finalized SVG, PDF, and PNG files of the game surfaces

 cuts/ - a set of pre-packaged cut files used to create smaller wooden blanks
         from larger wooden blanks

One SVG file in particular is a summary of all of the burn files, useful 
in Inkscape to review the individual layers:
