This project develops a board game along the lines of the long-played baseball board game, but brought up to date to include new rule changes at MLB.

Also, this version introduces an alternative play that involves pitching, something not included in the original. With pitching, both players are rolling dice for each inning.

Both the original "only batter rolls dice" and the new "batter and pitcher both roll dice" are played on the same board. The actions dictated for the mode of play not being played are simply ignored.

The board space is 200mm x 260mm, fitting within both US-letter and A4 paper sizes.
