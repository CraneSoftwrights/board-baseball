Here are PDF files to print to play the game on paper. The PDF files are precisely sized and so when printed at exactly 100% scaling will produce a playing space of 200mm x 260mm that will fit both on A4 andUS-letter page sizes.

Basic: [`basic-print-board-baseball-crane.pdf`](basic-print-board-baseball-crane.pdf)  
Extended: [`extended-print-board-baseball-crane.pdf`](extended-print-board-baseball-crane.pdf)  

### Creating the PDF files

To create these files, copy the desired design objects SVG file (e.g. [`design-board-baseball-crane.svg`](../design/design-board-baseball-crane.svg) over the print SVG objects files:

[`basic-objects-board-baseball-crane.pdf`](basic-objects-board-baseball-crane.pdf)  
[`extended-objects-board-baseball-crane.pdf`](extended-objects-board-baseball-crane.pdf)    

Manipulate each print SVG object file as follows:

- reveal the desired print layers
- select any out-of-bounds (outside the front cover bounding box) layer identification objects and delete them
- select all (the edge of the selection should match the front cover bounding box)
- in Document Properties change the document size to fit the selected content
- print the result to a PDF file:

[`basic-print-board-baseball-crane.pdf`](basic-print-board-baseball-crane.pdf)  
[`extended-print-board-baseball-crane.pdf`](extended-print-board-baseball-crane.pdf)
