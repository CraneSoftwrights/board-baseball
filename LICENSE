Copyright is claimed on the board layout and the extended play rules only, but 
not on the basic play rules dice combinations.

The basic play rules dice combinations are compatible with many other baseball 
dice games. A quick search on Amazon found these four examples of games for 
sale by different companies that all use the same dice combinations:

<img alt="" src="shared/other-game-2.png" style="height:300px"/>
<img alt="" src="shared/other-game-3.png" style="height:300px"/>

The extended play dice combinations replace those combinations in basic play 
that specify pitching-based play results.
