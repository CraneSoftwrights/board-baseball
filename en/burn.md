In [this `burn/` directory](../burn) are the SVG and PDF files used in the creation of final play products.

When beginning a new release, this directory should be emptied of every SVG and PDF file (leaving only this README file) so as not to leave the impression these burn files reflect the intermediate state of the design SVG file.

The files in this directory are created during the [build process documented here](build.md).
