In [this `burn/` directory](../burn) in the repository are the SVG and PNG directories of files used in the creation of final play products. The associated PDF files are in the `burn/` directory of the releases ZIP collection. 

The ZIP collections are found in the Actions results after each push, and on the releases page when pushes are made from the develop, qa, and main branches.

The files in this directory are created during the [build process documented here](build.md).
